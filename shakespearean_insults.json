"Away, you starvelling, you elf-skin, you dried neats's-tongue, bull's-pizzle, you stock-fish!",
"Come, come, you froward and unable worms!", 
"Thou art as fat as butter.", 
"Thou art unfit for any place but hell.",
"I am sick when I do look on thee", 
"I'll beat thee, but I would infect my hands.",
"I scorn you, scurvy companion.", 
"Methink'st thou art a general offence and every man should beat thee.", 
"More of your conversation would infect my brain.", 
"Peace, ye fat guts!", 
"Here is the babe, as loathsome as a toad.",
"There's no more faith in thee than in a stewed prune.", 
"Thine face is not worth sunburning.", 
"Thou art a boil, a plague sore", 
"Thou clay-brained guts, thou knotty-pated fool, thou whoreson obscene greasy tallow-catch!",
"Thou elvish-mark'd, abortive, rooting hog!", 
"Thou sodden-witted lord! Thou hast no more brain than I have in mine elbows."
